SQL Table statement:

CREATE TABLE sensordata  
(
	id int, 
	tilt int,
	light int,
	sensorTime timestamp DEFAULT current_timestamp
);     


INSERT INTO sensorsdata (id,titl,light) VALUES (1,0,2065);

I am planing to maintain a relational database of my sensorsdata, where I measure my being a nocturnal or day light digital laborer - 

he photon is hooked to my desk, that has a tray I open each time I sit. So tilt sensor will collect when I sit and how many hours I spend on my desk typing, (I checked though not really reliable, typing shakes the tray good enough to get that data in some occasions). 

ID  Tilt Light 
1    0    2065
